# letsdraw

A paint like app

## About

This app is part of my journey with **JS**. This app idea was just to build a canvas and a pencil, but I started to create some more functionalities, and practice some concepts of JS and coding and now it has a little bit more features than that. The pencil, was built from scratch, because the way that some canvas API methods work was leading to small issues. The color picker, was built with canvas and some pixels manipulation, because I really wanted to create a color picker from scratch, and the bucket fill was built using the flood fill algorithm. I really enjoy this project and I'll continue to add some features and changes. So this project still in progress.
