An paint like app

## About

This repo is a canvas practice project. I'm learning not just canvas but some interesting<br/>algorithms like flood filling algorithm (is used in the bucket fill function), it isn't exactly <br/>the way that I want right now, but it's a work in progress.<br/>

So if you want to take a look in how is the app right now click in the link below: <br/>
